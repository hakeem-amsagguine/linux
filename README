Linux kernel 6.9-rc3
============

There are several (very important) guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use the commands ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/ (Important)

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory, several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about the problems whic
h may result by upgrading your kernel.
Do not upgrade to the latest kernel version if your Distro doesn't have it in repo updates yet!
This is very important, for not only kernel devs but also common users compiling the linux kernal for the first time
Warning: If you configure the kernel wrong, your system might not work!

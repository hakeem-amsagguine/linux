Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
<br />be rendered in several formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
<br />[Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst) first.

To build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
<br />``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

   https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/


There are various text files in the [Documentation/](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/) subdirectory,
<br />several using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the [Documentation/process/changes.rst](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/changes.rst) file, as it contains the
<br />requirements for building and running the kernel and information about
<br />the problems that may result from upgrading your kernel.
